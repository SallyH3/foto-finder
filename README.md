## Project Title

# Foto Finder
---
As a solo project, I had to build an app where a user can upload photos with titles and captions. The user adds the photos to a 
photo gallery where it can persist on page load. 
The app provides the following:
1. Displays a title and caption that the user created.
2. Allows the user to upload photos and persist on page load.
3. Allows the user to favorite each card and persist on page load.
4. Allows the user to delete each card and persist on page load.
5. Allows user to edit their title or caption and persist changes on page load.
6. Allows user to live search for text within cards.
7. Allows user to 'show less' when there are more than 10 cards on the page.
8. The file selector only allows image types.
9. App is fully responsive and usable down to screens/viewport width of 320px
